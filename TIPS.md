With shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3` in the first line, it is possible to launch python script without
typing `python3 script.py` to launch it, only `./script.py` is fine.

`input()` --> we can enter any phrase we like and define it as an argument e.g name=input()

`print(arg)` --> prints an argument

`int()` --> can be used to change e.g input to integer

`str()` --> changes something to string

`import datetime` --> imports datetime library
